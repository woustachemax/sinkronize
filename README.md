# Hello World, Welcome to Sinkronize üîÑ

A wise person once said, ***"You can just build things."*** üì≤
However, turning that simple idea into reality often requires either significant prompting or the collaboration of a highly skilled co-builder to stay on track and effectively "build things."
That's precisely where Sinkronize comes in.‚ú®

Sinkronize isn't just a passion project, a complete end-to-end application designed to connect individuals who share your ambition but may need assistance or are ready to offer their expertise in building.üî•

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Get the code:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/woustachemax/sinkronize.git
    cd sinkronize
    ```

2.  **Install the tools:**

    Use either npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Or Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up the database:**

    * Create a new database named `sinkronize` in your local PostgreSQL.
    * Find the `.env` file in the main folder of the project and open it.
    * Change the lines that start with `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET` to match your PostgreSQL settings and a secret key. Here's an example:

        ```env
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://yourusername:yourpassword@localhost:5432/sinkronize"
        JWT_SECRET="your_secret_key_here"
        ```

4.  **Prepare the database:**

    Sinkronize uses Prisma to manage the database. Run this command to set up the database structure:

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    npx prisma generate
    ```

5.  **Start the application:**

    After setting up the database, start the local development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will make the project accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
