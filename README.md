# Welcome to Sinkronize

A wise person once said, **"You can just build things."** However, turning that simple idea into reality often requires either significant prompting or the collaboration of a highly skilled co-builder to stay on track and effectively "build things." That's precisely where Sinkronize comes in.

Sinkronize is a passion project â€“ a complete end-to-end application designed to connect individuals who share your ambition but may need assistance or are ready to offer their expertise in building.

## How It Was Built

Sinkronize leverages a straightforward yet powerful text-based stack, incorporating:

* **Validation:** Zod
* **Password Hashing:** bcrypt

* **Authentication:** Implementation of Google Auth for seamless login functionality.
