# SkillSync

SkillSync helps you connect with like-minded individuals, forming meaningful teams in a world where AI and humans collaborate seamlessly. This app facilitates the development of genuine connections, bringing together people with complementary skills and shared goals.

So far, Iâ€™ve developed the homepage using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. My vision is to expand this app into a platform where individuals can connect, collaborate, and grow together, leveraging the power of AI to foster real teamwork.
